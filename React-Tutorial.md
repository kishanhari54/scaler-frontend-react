# Things to Learn in React.

# How to build a React App?

## Initial App Rendering explained
  * App.js has a function which returns JSX
  * Index.js , appends this function from App.js to a HTML element with id "root"
## Creating a Component in React
* Create a function ,in a js file , this function will return a JSX.* <br/>
       ```
       function Test(){ 
        return (
            <div> Content To be Sent </div>
        )
        }
        ```

<br/>


## Creating a Child Component
  * Create a ProductList.js and ProductCard.js file 
    * export a JSX from ProductCard.js
    * import ProductCard in ProductList and use the selector.
    * To Pass data , pass it along its element , in example we have passed title and price
    * It is recommended to use "className" to define css classes (to not confuse with class keyword of js)
  ```
    function ProductCard(properties){
            return ( <div>Product Card<div/>
            <p> Title : {properties.title}</p>
            <p> Title : {properties.price}</p>
            )
    }

    function ProductList(){
        return (
            <div className="productList">
            <ProductCard title="Heading" price="20">
            </div>
        )
    }
  ```
  * To Pass Parameters , the properties can be passed in the selector and consumed it with interpolation {}

<br/>

## Looping to render elements multiple times
  * If you want to loop to create multiple child components. - Use Map Function.
  * Define a Product Array ,and loop through array to create the HTML Element.
  * We use Curly braces to define Javascript Expressions.
```
  products = [ {title: 'TEST' , price: '200'}]
  function ProductList(){
        return (
            <div className="productList">
            {products.map( 
              
              function( product){
              
                return (
                  <ProductCard title={product.title} price={product.price}>
                )
              
              }
            )
            }
            
            </div>
        )
    }
    
```

<br/> 

## Importing CSS
  * Create a css file and import it in js file.
    * CSS File was "productCard.css"
    * in ProductCard.js file use " import "./productCard.css"

## Named Exports and Imports
  * We can create a index.js file for every component and export the function in this file.
  * The advantage of this is : It helps for cleaner import statements. 
  * Import statements can specify till folder and need not provide js name specifically.
